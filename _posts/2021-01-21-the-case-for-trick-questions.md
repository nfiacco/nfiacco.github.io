title:  "The Case for Trick Questions"

When I first started interviewing for software engineering jobs, every once in a while I would come across a question
that would leave me stumped and thinking I wasn't smart enough. Eventually, I learned that some questions had a "trick"
to them, and decided that these were unfair. But in fact, these questions have value precisely because my problem
solving skills alone did not suffice.

Since it is nearly impossible to figure out the trick  on the spot, the only way to find the solution is to have
seen the problem (or a similar one) before. Therefore, what these questions are probing for is actually work ethic--
an incredibly important attribute that is  often overlooked in software engineering.

Knowing the purpose of these "trick" questions has changed my opinion of them, and I've decided they are an important
aspect of any interview loop. If you know a better way to gauge how hard-working a candidate is, I'd love to hear
about it. Find me on Twitter!
