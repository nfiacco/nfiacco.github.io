Hi, I'm Nick.

I've been trying to start a blog for a few years now, but every time I give up. Writing a full-length blog post
has always been a major obstacle--I generally only have a few interesting thoughts to share on a given topic. To
solve that problem, I decided to start 10 Sentences. The goal is to lower the barrier for me to start writing,
to force my thoughts to be more concise, and to write something that I myself wouldn't get bored reading.

I hope you guys find it interesting!
