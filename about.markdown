Hi, I'm Nick. I've been trying to start a blog for a few years now, but every time I give up. Writing a full blog post
has always been intimidating to me-- I rarely feel that I have enough to say to reach the length of all the other blog
posts I see out there. To overcome that mental block, I decided to start 10 Sentences. The goal is to both lower the
barrier for me to start writing, to force my thoughts to be more concise, and to write something that I myself wouldn't
get bored reading. I hope you guys find it interesting!
